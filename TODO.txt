✅ function for randomizing next pieces
✅ give pieces different chars
✅ gamePieces should only have one piece (the active one).
- make pieces fall automatically
- show next piece in UI
- gameBoard should hide its internal structure
- remove rotation member from gamePiece if dynamic rotation algorithm is used
- add text document with piece shapes(?)
- wall kicks

🐛 gravity shouldn't pull existing pieces as far down as possible, only the number of lines removed under it
